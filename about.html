          <p>My name is Seth Kornbau, and I am a full-time undergraduate student at the University
          of Pittsburgh in the Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences with an intended major
          in Computer Science. I have interests in software engineering, software and web
          development, IT, and cyber security (of course, I'm open to other opportunites in
          different fields). I aspire to one day become a full-time software engineer.</p>
          <p>My primary programming languages include Java, Python, HTML5, and CSS, but I am
           constantly expanding my programming knowledge and am actively searching for new
           language skills to develop. Specifically, I am looking for experience with either front-end or
           back-end software development in a professional setting.</p>
          <p>Here at Pitt, I am a member of the Computer Science Club, which is looking to expand its
            involvement with open source projects to benefit the campus community. I look forward to
            actively participating in the development of these projects to both build on my open source
            portfolio and develop professional skills.</p>
